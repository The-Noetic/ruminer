# The Ruminer Palais


Welcome to [Ruminer](), my [Digital Garden]() where I document my ruminations.
*Ruminer Palais* in French loosely translates to *"ruminate palace"*.
This is my corner of the internet where I write
about [Machine Learning, Programming, Productivity]() and opinionated pieces on
[Lifestyle, Technology, Sports]() and other things that call my attention.

Staying true to the idea of *Digital Gardens*, articles on this website can
be considered as plants that are growing continuously. Articles are in
various stages of growth- some polished, some rough ideas and everything
in between- as I tend to them with time. The goal is to construct my ideas,
ruminate, capture what I learn, and share them with you in a navigable
archive.

    text__, images, ... basically anything that can be expressed in Markdown.
