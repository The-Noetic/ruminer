Google search has become the gateway to the internet. Googling requires a knack of
using the right keywords to get relevant content. I call this the art of googling.
Often times I get asked simple queries which leaves me thinking *Why couldn't they 
have just googled this*. Googling is one of the most under appreciated and under
estimated skill.

Over the years the quality of Google Search has dropped with the algorithm focusing
more on ads and SEO which has enabled content providers to game the system producing
irrelevant results. Finding content that is actually relevant has become harder.
This article covers some crucial tips for refining your search and utilizing the full
power of Google.

## Google search operators
Google search operators are specific characters and commands that extend the capabilities
of basic text searches. Search operators as the term suggests a collection of operators/
args that allow you to tailor your search to exactly what you need. 
Below is a small cheatsheet on the different operators and how to use them.

### Basic operators
| Operator | Function |
| -------- | -------- |
| "" | Use this operator for exact search. For eg. to search only for Model 3 `"tesla model 3"`|
| \| | This is the OR operator. For eg. if you want to search for tesla or mercedes `tesla \| mercedes`. This is especially useful for multiple word queries as google defaults to AND| 
| - | Put - in front of terms(including operators) that you want to exclude from results |
| * | Wildcard operator. For eg. `"the sky is *"` |
| .. | Range operator. Eg. `Mercedes cars 2020..2022` |
| () | Use this operator to group operators by priority |

## Advanced Operators
| Operator | Function |
| -------- | -------- |
| intitle: | Search only within pages title |
| allintitle: | Show results for all queried words in the title |
| inurl: | Look for a word or phrase in urls of sites |
| allinurl: | Similar to allintitle but for urls |
| intext: | Search for words in body of document |
| allintext: | Similar behavior for all words |
| filetype: | Search for specific file types for eg. ppt, pdf etc |

# Chaining Operators 
The search operators unlock an extra level of control over your search results. You can
chain together multiple operators to create precise queries.
