I am [Rishikanth Chandrasekaran](), a CSE PhD Student at the [University of California, San Diego]((https://cse.ucsd.edu)).
Prior to joining UCSD I completed my Masters in Computer Engineering at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu), New York.

I spend most of my time musing over Deep Learning models. My research focuses on exploiting the synergy
between Deep Learning and Hyperdimensional Computing to enable lightweight learning for various domains
such as Meta Learning, Federated Learning, Computer Vision and NLP.
